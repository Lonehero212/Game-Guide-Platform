            <h1>TIP #1 Star Chart</h1>
            <p>The Star Chart is the primary way to embark on missions through the Navigation on the Orbiter. Trekking through the Star Chart will open up new planets, locales, and even open-world environments with your first major landscape being the Plains of Eidolon on Earth, Cetus. The Star Chart is used similarly as a tutorial for new players.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Daily/Weekly Missions</h1>
            <p>Invasions are missions, where you will be tasked to choose to help either the Grineer or Corpus for three missions. After completing the chosen side after three missions, you will be rewarded with a resource reward, either the Detonite Injector or the Fieldron. Detonite Injectors and Fieldrons are used to craft many different types of weapons. Invasions are the ideal/swiftest way to earn Detonite Injectors and Fieldrons. You can craft them too, but it is recommended to get these resources from Invasions. Sometimes Invasions will reward you with weapon parts or blueprints to craft weapons. You will know beforehand the rewards you can obtain. Completing each set of Invasion missions can take less than 20 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Weapons</h1>
            <p>Warframe has dozens of different weapons to collect and use. Initially, weapons are sorted into three main categories: Primary, Secondary, and Melee. Primary Weapons can be Snipers, Bows, Shotguns, and Assault Rifles. Secondary Weapons can be Submachine Guns, Throwing Knives, and Pistols. Melee Weapons can be Whips, Daggers, Swords, Dual Swords, Scythes, Great Swords, Fists, and Staffs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Weapon Mastery</h1>
            <p>When reaching Max Rank on any weapon the first time, it will be completed for increasing your Mastery Rank. A higher Mastery Rank will allow you to wield stronger, much more powerful weapons. Fulfilling each Mastery Rank will allow you the option to complete a Mastery Rank Test. Upon completion, your Mastery Rank will increase by one.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Joining Clans</h1>
            <p>Many Warframe players and folks in the Global/Region Chats will help in answering questions or even aid you with support in missions. Make sure to say you are a new player and looking for an active Clan. Clans are not recommended to start alone. It is absolutely a full-time job, and it is beneficial to join a Clan that has already been around for a few years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Choose Yourself</h1>
            <p>Do you want to go Eidolon Hunting of huge Kaiju monstrosities? Spend hours Fishing or Mining for resources on the Plains of Eidolon? How about completing low-level Bounties on Cetus? Warframe allows you to do what you want as a player. You will have to go through the Star Chart, but you will find an immense amount of activities to do just from Earth. Start by earning Standing from different in-game Syndicates such as on Cetus to unlock more of the game from new Warframes, Companions, or Weapons. Earning Relics on Cetus will allow you to use them in Void Fissures, which can give you more powerful Prime weapon parts that are immeasurably more lethal than their original weapon counterparts.</p>

        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Understand the Factions</h1>
            <p>First, you need to understand the three factions and how they impact your gameplay. You don’t want to fight factions at random because it won’t bode well for your gameplay. Learning about the three main groups will make you a better player.
                You’ll come across:
                
                Grineer: You’ll find that this faction doesn’t take security seriously, so you may mistake them for being easy to kill. However, they know that power in numbers can help them thwart most attacks. Enemies in this faction are difficult to take down, use powerful weapons and will try to outnumber you.
                Corpus: Well, while the Grineer doesn’t focus on security, the Corpus certainly does. This faction uses drones that fly into combat with them and are known for laying traps.
                Infestation: A dangerous faction. The Infestation faction will drain your energy and use swarming tactics to try and overwhelm you in battle. Often, you’ll be taken by surprise and won’t last through this type of onslaught.
                While other factions do exist, these are the three that you must master because they’re the foes that you’ll face in battle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Stealth Is Underrated</h1>
            <p>Running into the fray and attacking enemies is a lot of fun, but you’re a new player and likely underpowered. Levels go up to 100, and if you face foes much higher than you, you’ll have a clear disadvantage in gameplay and survivability.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Weapon Modifications Are Game Changers</h1>
            <p>Weapon mods are game-changers. Modding will make your weapons do more damage and possibly have stronger status effects. 

                It can take some time and practice to get good at modding, but it’s a great habit to get into. Modding is more complex than you might think, but it’s worth learning.
                
                There are plenty of simple mods, like those that add 10% more damage. However, if you can take the time to really learn the modding system, you can create some powerful things.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10  Always Build Extractors</h1>
            <p>Extractors are unique items that will generate items for your passively. Build them, and then set them and forget them. You don’t have to lift a finger.

                Always build extractors when you can. You can find blueprints on the normal market, and you can reuse them whenever you want. It will cost you 50,000 credits to buy one.</p>
