        <div class="Tips">
            <div class="Tip1">
            <h1>TIP #1 Note The Free Customization Changes</h1>
            <p>As with any huge MMOs, newcomers getting into PSO2 will likely want to "get everything right" the first time. Seeing their first few hours of investments go out the window can definitely ruin their playthrough. Thankfully, a lot of major character choices come with handy reversible options. However, some changes don't always come for free.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Afin And Cofy Get Through The Fundamentals</h1>
            <p>When newcomers venture into PSO2 for the first time, it's easy to get overwhelmed with a ton of options available. First-timers will likely have the urge to just Google every new concept they come across. Players tempted to give in to the temptation should probably just go with the flow until they're instructed to talk to Afin and Cofy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Classes Form The Core Progression System</h1>
            <p>The main gimmick of PSO2 lies in its vastly customizable Class System. ARKS Operatives can become any Class they wish. As they progress, players can come up with a character that's uniquely their own simply by their Class dynamics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Think Of Combat As A Rhythm Game</h1>
            <p>Unlike other MMOs, PSO2 is more or less a mixture of action elements with point-and-click gameplay. Essentially, rotations aren't just about button-mashing keymaps as soon as their CDs restart. Rather, PSO2 combat needs players to follow a "rhythm" in order to maximize damage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Gear Depends On Class, Stats</h1>
            <p>Players might realize that loot in PSO2 also remains heavily dependent on Class. In fact, Classes can only equip very specific Weapons and gear, so not all loot will fit a particular character. Players need to take some things into considerations as well</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 The Mag Is A Living Buff</h1>
            <p>Players should remember that their Mag isn't just a cute pet they carry with them. They should actively take care of their Mag as this creature can provide a ton of benefits that could greatly benefit a player's overall experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Keep Daily Orders In Check</h1>
            <p>As with other MMOs, PSO2 does have a daily quest system. By the time players unlock their Daily Orders, they can get various daily quests that act like secondary objectives throughout various missions. Players shouldn't ignore them as completing these objectives gives them useful benefits</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Consider The Smurf Characters</h1>
            <p>Anyone who plays PSO2 that's come from another MMO will understand the idea of smurf characters. After all, why settle for a single character when players can explore different playstyles with multiple ones, right? In PSO2, the game also encourages playing with multiple characters in the same account.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Multiplayer Benefits The Farming Experience</h1>
            <p>PSO2 newcomers can play solo to fully immerse themselves in the game world. However, PSO2 also heavily encourages multiplayer experience. For instance, partying with other characters actually provides buffs for all participants.

                Parties who do the same quest or missions receive a boost to both experience and item drops. Players who want to farm levels quickly could do so through raids even on early levels. Players can get into the active raiding component of PSO2 much earlier without waiting to get into the endgame.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Consider The Alliance</h1>
            <p>Aside from partying with other people, players should consider joining an Alliance for the benefit of their players. PSO2's Alliances act as the counterpart of a guild in the game. Aside from having new playmates, players can gain some other benefits when joining these groups:</p>
