            <div class="Tip1">
            <h1>TIP #1 Complete the Starter's Events</h1>
            <p>The Starter’s Events are a series of events or missions that are only available to new players. Each of these events offers great rewards upon completion of each mission. In fact, you can get excellent Valkyries from these events, which will surely help you progress throughout the game. You can also get augment cores, equipment, forging materials, and diamonds from these events. Below is a list of notable events in the Starter’s Events that new players should focus on in the early parts of the game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Missions Priority</h1>
            <p>Knowing which mission to start with can be very confusing, especially for new players. It can be very overwhelming for beginners. Thus, in this Impact 3rd beginner's guide, we have made a mission priority list to guide beginners.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Stamina Usage Priority</h1>
            <p>Again, filling up the stamina bar reduces your stamina accumulation rate. Thus, it is important that you will be able to utilize your stamina before it reaches the maximum amount. However, you should make sure that you spend your stamina wisely, considering the limited amount of stamina available. Don't you worry though, we've also made up a list to guide new players in Honkai Impact 3rd to utilize their stamina. Here is a list of events/missions where you should prioritize spending your stamina:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Avoid unlocking/upgrading your Valkyrie’s Switch Skills</h1>
            <p> This is strongly recommended to players planning to join the competitive scene. Switch skills tend to lessen the synergy of your Valkyries’ stigmatas. If you want to maximize your Valkyrie’s capabilities, especially during late game, then a good practice would be to avoid unlocking/upgrading switch skills.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Never use experience chips</h1>
            <p>As much as possible, keep your level low. Instead of focusing on leveling up, focus on upgrading your Valkyrie’s level. Make sure you check out the Valkyrie Farming Guide to check which Valkyrie’s to prioritize on upgrading.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Join an Armada</h1>
            <p> A max-level Tier V Armada is a recommended Armada that you should join. Once you are in an Armada, make sure you stay active and contribute to the Armada Missions. The Dailies should guide you on which Armada Missions you have not completed yet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Find a Sensei</h1>
            <p>Having a sensei will unlock Sensei Missions. Sensei Missions offers great rewards upon completion. Finding a sensei should be easy, so you won’t need to worry about it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Don’t let your stamina overflow</h1>
            <p>If you let your stamina reach max, the stamina accumulation will slow down. Make sure your stamina bar is not full to maximize stamina accumulation. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Teamwork</h1>
            <p>There are special maneuvers that allow you to execute a swap and strike tactic. To make the attack most effective, you need to properly position for the swap and have an idea of what the Valkyrie swapping in is going to strike with. For instance, Bronya’s special attack draws enemies together, then allows for another valkyrie to switch in to cause massive damage to the entrapped enemies. But, if you swap in a valkyrie whose type is ineffective against those enemy types, you will have wasted big maneuver for little results.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Choose Your First Valkyrie Carefully</h1>
            <p>f you complete every challenge on every mission during a Chapter, you can earn as many as 225 premium Crystals. However, you need 2,800 of these to summon 10 supply crates and take advantage of the better S Valkyrie drop rates. Unfortunately, that’s a lot of Crystals. Although you do receive some from various achievements along the way, it’s likely that you’ll have to complete upwards of 3 chapters to purchase your first decent draw.</p>
