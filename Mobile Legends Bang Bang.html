                <h1>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</h1>
                <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Moonton, a subsidiary of ByteDance. The game was released in 2016 and grew in popularity, most prominently in Southeast Asia. At its core, the game pits 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 10-second matchmaking and 10-minute matches. Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angleâ€”winners and losers are decided based on skill, ability, and strategy</p>

            <h1>TIP #1 characters</h1>
            <img src="Images/MLT1.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Previously, Minion Lanes in Mobile Legends didn't have any particular difference from others. However, now there are two different routes that contain different resource bonuses. These Lanes are called the Gold and EXP Lane. The EXP Lane always coincides with the initial Turtle Lane, and Siege Minions in this lane will grant 50% extra EXP.

                Meanwhile, the Gold Lane has a 50% Gold bonus. Typically, Marksmen and a Tank/Support will go to the Gold Lane while the EXP one is protected by a solo Fighter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Beware Of Enhanced Minions</h1>
            <img src="Images/MLT2.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>When the game first starts, the Minions will be weak and easy to kill. They get stronger as the match goes on, but these enemies are squishy even then. However, they do have an enhanced form, which players can easily notice by their significantly larger size. Of course, in this state, they are both stronger and can take more hits before going down. These Minions can easily overwhelm units that have a long skill cool down.

                To get these Super Minions, players have to destroy the opponent's Base Turret (the Tower near the Base). Additionally, if someone kills the Lord, the allied Minions will be enhanced for one wave.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Remember It's A Tower Game</h1>
            <img src="Images/MLT3.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Mobile Legends has a scoring system to determine the MVP of the match. Currently, this system highly favors ADC units that can kill a lot of enemies. This may cause some people to get obsessed with overkilling. Unfortunately, MLBB is essentially a Tower game, so if players want to win, they should remember to destroy the enemy's Turret and push for the Base.

                Of course, it's very easy to get lost in chasing enemies. However, in the long run, doing so will greatly hurt the team's pushing progress.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Hitting Turret Can Grants Gold</h1>
            <img src="Images/MLT4.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>In the first five minutes of the game, if players are handling a Lane, it's important to remember that the protected Turret will grant Gold if it's damaged. Players will gain one Gold for every 10 damage, and can earn up to 500 Gold this way. So if players manage to make the opponent retreat, don't forget to take the opportunity to hit the Tower.

                Remember not to be pushy, though. Heroes around the Turret's AoE will receive 15% less damage, so approach the enemy with caution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Emblem Talent Can Make A Huge Difference</h1>
            <img src="Images/MLT5.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Similar to Held Items in Pokemon Unite, Mobile Legends has Emblems that can be assigned to a hero before the battle begins. In total, there are nine types of Emblems. Each of them can be upgraded to level 60.

                The most important part of Emblem is that players can customize each Emblem to best fit a hero and their play style. Furthermore, each of them also has special talents to choose from. For Physical and Magic Emblems, there are two special talents, while the other seven have three. Knowing which hero needs which talent will help players' journey in the Land of Dawn.</p>

        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Level Up To Unlock Battle Spells</h1>
            <img src="Images/MLT6.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>For new players, most of the Battle Spells will be locked. The last Battle Spell, Vengeance, can be unlocked at level 23. However, two of the most popular Spells, Flameshot and Flicker are unlocked at levels 17 and 19 respectively.

                Flicker is used to instantly teleport a short distance. This is crucial for both chasing and running. Meanwhile, Flameshot can snipe an enemy far away and push the opponents if they are too close to the hero. To level up quickly, players can use an item to double the received EXP.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 The Turtle And The Lord</h1>
            <p>There are two large monsters Mobile Legends players need to know; Turtle and Lord.

                Turtle
                Appears after three minutes and leaves after seven minutes of game time
                Killing the Turtle grants a Turtle buff to the killer
                Lord
                Appears after nine minutes of game time
                The Lord will fight alongside the killer's team, opening a chance to push the opponents' Tower
                Killing both the Turtle and the Lord rewards EXP and Gold for the whole team. However, these monsters aren't easy to kill. So players should call their teammates to defeat the bosses together.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 The Buffs And The Creeps</h1>
            <img src="Images/MLT8.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Just like a typical MOBA, Mobile Legends has several buffs the players can utilize. The first two are commonly called the Blue and Red buff.

                Blue buff grants cooldown and Mana cost reduction
                Red buff can slow the enemy while dealing extra damage
                Some heroes can benefit greatly from these buffs while others don't need it at all. Therefore, players should let the heroes that need the buff take it. Other than that, two other creeps grant a smaller buff; The Crab and Lithowanderer.

                Gold buff, granted by the Crab , yields 10 Gold every 3s to the killer
                Killing Lithowanderer spawn a Walkie Grass , which will follow the killer, restoring 1% Mana every second to nearby allied heroes</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Know Your Role</h1>
            <img src="Images/MLT9.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>There are six roles available in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. Each of these roles has a lane they perform best in:

                Mages generally take the Middle Lane , where they can easily help both Top and Bottom Lane
                Marksmen highly rely on equipment, so they need to take the Gold Lane
                Fighters need the EXP Lane to level up quickly
                Assassins mostly camp in the Jungle
                Tanks and Supports have to roam around the map to help their teammates
                Knowing the roles will immensely increase the team's synergy, allowing gamers to win easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Counter Enemy's Equipment</h1>
            <img src="Images/MLT10.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Throughout each match, players can check everyone's equipment. This may seem overwhelming for beginners, but it's a crucial habit to have. In Mobile Legends, there are three types of damage; Magic, Physical, and True Damage. Each of these has a counter of its own.

                For example, if most of the enemies are Magical heroes, then Magic Defense will significantly increase survivability. On the other hand, if an enemy uses Magic Defense, a Mage can buy equipment with Magic PEN. This allows them to disregard the opponent's defense.</p>
