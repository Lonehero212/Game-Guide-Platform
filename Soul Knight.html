                <h1>Soul Knight</h1>
                <p>Soul Knight is a pixel roguelike RPG that looks easy at the beginning but gets hard as you level up. The game starts with you, as a knight, entering a dungeon and killing monsters. The dungeon has multiple rooms and clearing each gives you gold.

                    In simple words, it's a shooting game that has very easy controls and anyone can enjoy it. But keep in mind that if you fail at any level, the game will begin from level 1.</p>

        <div class="Tips">
            <div class="Tip1">
            <h1>TIP #1 Melee Weapons are Important</h1>
            <p>Melee weapons will help you save that energy to use some high-end guns. Besides, they are much better for close combat and often kill the enemies in one shot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Don't Run Out of Energy</h1>
            <p>Energy is the blue stat bar on the top left. If you waste it by using a gun too much, you won't be able to use the weapon until the energy is restored.

                Therefore, make sure that you are always fighting with a secondary weapon as well, preferably melees.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Keep Moving While Fighting</h1>
            <p>If you've played any shooting game in your life, you'd know the importance of movement, especially in fast-paced games. Similar is the case with Soul Knight.

                If you just stand in a corner and hold that shoot button, you might kill a few enemies but won't survive for long. So keep moving to dodge the attacks of the monsters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Keep a Distance from Enemies</h1>
            <p>Another important thing is to not go too close to the enemies. Close attacks affect more of your HP and you might lose your lives early. So, utilize your guns and hit from afar.

                Even if you come face to face at some point, the melee will come into play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Take Cover While Fighting</h1>
            <p>This is essential when you're low on HP, recovering your energy, or recharging the armor.Hide behind a block and dodge some attacks until you recover yourself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Upgrade Your Hero Regularly</h1>
            <p>The faster you upgrade your heroes, the quicker you'll complete the game. It is almost impossible to complete Soul Knight with just the base character cards.

                So, save your gold, convert them into gems, and use them to upgrade the characters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Open Chests After Clearing Rooms</h1>
            <p>Chests give you new or better weapons, coins, buffs, or some other upgrades depending on the level of chest you are opening.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Watch Your Armor and Skill Bar</h1>
            <p>Before entering the next room with enemies, wait for your armor and skill bar to regenerate.

                Armor is extremely important to survive in fights and you could be required to use your skill anytime.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Avoid Champion Rooms at the Start</h1>
            <p>Champion rooms will be really difficult for a newbie to survive and if they do, the HP will take a big hit.

                So, if you notice a double exclamation mark on the map and the room has red gates, it's better to avoid it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Save Your Gold and Don't Waste Your Gems</h1>
            <p>It's recommended to avoid using gold until necessary in the dungeons. Why? Because the saved gold alongside the number of enemies you've killed, will be converted into gems.

                And we know, gems are super useful to upgrade your characters.
                
                And this was all about the Soul Knight guide, tips, tricks, and codes. The game is really challenging and forces you to try new strategies each time to finish it.</p>
