                <h1>Tower of Fantasy</h1>
                <p>Tower of Fantasy is a free-to-play open world action role-playing game developed by Hotta Studio, a subsidiary of Perfect World. The game is set in the far future on the extraterrestrial planet "Aida", contaminated with a mysterious but potent radioactive energy called Omnium after a cataclysm that nearly wiped out human civilization and mutated the ecology of the planet. The player plays a wanderer that explores the world and fights mutant creatures and hostile forces as they advance through the story.</p>

            <h1>TIP #1 Strategically Create Your Character</h1>
            <img src="Images/TF1.png" alt="Photo">
            <p>In Tower of Fantasy, you can create your own anime character, just like in those big multiplayer online games. It’s like making your dream character. But be careful; some choices will stay forever unless you create a new character. You can change some things later, like your clothes and hairstyle, but only some things. So, when you start the game, think carefully about how you want your character to look and be.</p>

        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Finish the Tutorial & Start Leveling Up</h1>
            <img src="Images/TF2.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>Even though it might feel a bit slow, finishing the first part of Tower of Fantasy as quickly as possible is a good idea. The real fun starts when you reach the first Omnium Tower. Then, you can use the gacha system to get better and stronger weapons.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Opt for Powerful Weapons</h1>
            <img src="Images/TF3.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>One of the Tower of Fantasy Tips you must not forget is to obtain powerful weapons in the game. After you’ve finished learning how to play Tower of Fantasy and unlock the gacha system, it’s time to get better weapons. Don’t keep using the starting blue weapons for too long, and don’t spend resources to make them stronger. You’ll have enough money to start getting new weapons by playing the game and getting rewards. Look for weapons with SSR and SR ranks because they’re stronger and have better stats than the blue ones (and they come with special characters you can play as called simulacrum).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Start Rerolling To Get Your Favorite Character</h1>
            <img src="Images/TF4.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>If you’re unhappy with the weapons you get from the gacha game, you have another choice. If you don’t get a strong SSR weapon after trying a few times, you can make a new game account and try again. This might take a lot of time, but you can do it if you want a specific weapon to start your adventure.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Equip Your Weapons With Elements</h1>
            <p>You must know the elements you can put on your weapons. Different elements are really important in Tower of Fantasy’s fights. For example, weapons with fire can make enemies burn and hurt them slowly, and icy weapons can freeze them. Some enemies are weaker against certain elements or have a shield that only breaks when you use a different element. Also, some puzzles need certain elemental weapons to solve.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Focus on Charge & Shatter Stats</h1>
            <p>One of the most important Tower of Fantasy tips and tricks you must consider is the charge and the shatter. A weapon with a high Shatter rate is better at breaking enemy shields. A weapon with a high Charge quickly fills up a meter, letting you make a strong attack when you switch weapons. Knowing which weapons are good at each of these things is a big part of how you fight, so don’t pick three weapons that are all good at breaking shields but not good at building up the Charge. When an enemy has no shield, use a weapon that’s good at building Charge. Then, when the enemy gets a shield, switch to your best weapon for breaking shields.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Play the Dailies</h1>
            <img src="Images/TF7.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>One of the Tower of Fantasy tips you must not miss in the game is the dailies. Every day, you can do four special tasks that give you lots of different kinds of money and XP. This is helpful, especially if you can’t do the main story for a while. These tasks help you level up. Besides these tasks, you can do several other things each day. Some of them use up your energy, which comes back over time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Don’t Miss Exploring</h1>
            <img src="Images/TF8.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>Like in Genshin Impact, a big thing in Tower of Fantasy is wandering around the game’s big world. When you explore, you can find puzzles to solve and collect things. This helps you get more chances to get new weapons, XP, stuff to strengthen your character, and more. You’ll also get special rewards when you explore a lot in different areas, like a mushroom that makes you stronger forever or cool items called Relics that greatly help you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Get Everything</h1>
            <img src="Images/TF9.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>As you know how to play Tower of Fantasy, it’s always good to be ready. You have a big space to keep things, so don’t worry about collecting vegetables, fruits, or things to improve your weapons when exploring. These things will be useful later for cooking or making your weapons stronger. Sometimes, you need a specific amount of a certain thing for daily tasks or side quests. If you’ve been picking up these things while you explore, you can finish tasks and quests quickly without doing much, which is good.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Start Joining a Crew</h1>
            <p>Another Tower of Fantasy tip you must not forget is joining groups like guilds, but they’re called Crews. You can do special Crew missions and donate things while in a Crew. These give you more rewards and special Crew money that you can use to get cool stuff. Since you’ll probably be doing these missions anyway, joining a Crew is a way to get even more rewards from your daily and weekly tasks.</p>
