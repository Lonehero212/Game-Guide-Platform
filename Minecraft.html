                <h1>Minecraft</h1>
                <p>Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios and originally released in 2009. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released on November 18, 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has become the best-selling video game in history, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023. Over the years following its release, it has been ported to several platforms, including PC, mobile and various consoles.</p>

            <div class="Tip1">
            <h1>TIP #1 Punch A Tree</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT1.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Starting out you have nothing; no tools, no weapons, no shelter, nothing. The first thing you need to do is arm yourself with some tools. To do this, walk up to the nearest tree and start punching it until the wood drops.

                Wood is the basic building block you’ll be using for the rest of the game. Gather a bunch of logs then open your inventory to turn the logs into planks. Use four planks in your mini crafting grid to create a Crafting Bench and open up a world of possibility.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Acquire Stone Tools</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT2.avif" alt="Photo">            
            <p>Using this Crafting Bench, you can build yourself a wooden pickaxe. To do this, craft a set of sticks and use the sticks with wood planks to craft the pickaxe. It’s highly recommended you have the crafting guide pulled up as there are a lot of things to craft, and it’ll spare you hours of trial and error to figure out what you can and can’t build. Thankfully, Minecraft has a little green book that you can open from the menu, showing all recipes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Build a shelter</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT3.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Nightfall is very dangerous in Minecraft as there are monsters known as mobs that come out at night to attack you. Later these mobs will become another cog in your machine to progress, but in the beginning, they are your biggest threat.

                The best way to avoid this is to sleep in a bed built by killing sheep and using their wool plus wood to craft it. Unfortunately, sheep are only found in specific biomes so odds are your first night is going to be spent hiding indoors. Whether it’s dirt, wood, or stone, use your tools to gather enough of your chosen material to build a basic shelter. Most Minecrafters have fond memories of their first base; a square made from dirt.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Set Your Spawn Point</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT4.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>When you die in Minecraft, you will respawn at the coordinates 0,0. This is where you begin the game, but it's typically not where you choose to settle. To avoid this, be sure to set your spawn point.

                This can simply be done by sleeping in a bed, or just clicking on the bed during the day. When you do this, your spawn point is set and you will respawn on your bed whenever you die.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Find Some Food</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT5.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Now that you have a shelter to keep yourself alive at night, your next issue is going to be keeping yourself properly nourished. Every action in the game, such as mining and running, costs you hunger. When the hunger bar is full, your character will naturally heal from any injuries, but lose a little hunger and you stop healing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Light It Up</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT6.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Most mobs in the game hate light, which is why they don’t appear until nighttime. Keeping the inside of your shelter lit will prevent any mobs from spawning inside. To do this you need torches.

                To build torches you can either gather coal from the environment or make charcoal by creating a furnace using stone blocks and then ‘cooking’ wooden logs to make charcoal. Charcoal will be handy later for smelting projects, but for now, place it on top of a stick in your crafting table to create torches. These torches can then be placed practically anywhere to generate light and prevent mob spawns from happening in the area.</p>

        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Write Down Your Base's Coordinates</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT7.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Before setting out in the world, it's important to note where you are. Exploration can be fun, but you may get turned around, especially if your base is in a common area like a plains biome.

                We recommend writing your coordinates down. If you are playing on PC (Java), you can show coordinates by pressing F3 (FN + F3 on Mac). If you are on the Bedrock version of Minecraft, you will need to enable coordinates when creating your world. Thankfully, you can head back to the edit world button from the main menu and enable coordinates if you forgot to when creating the world.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Build A Chest</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT8.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Chests are great for storing items and are quite easy to make. At the start of the game, you will probably be hoarding everything that you come across. To ease the inventory clutter, be sure to make a chest or two. Placing two chests will make a double chest.

                Placing important items in chests will also help you avoid permanently losing them if you die. A great tip is to store important tools in a chest if you are exploring somewhere that looks dangerous. When you do die, your tools will still be intact.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Find A Cave</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT9.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>With a basic shelter, a supply of food, tools, and torches your next step is to find a cave. Caves are naturally created tunnels and crevices in the environment that extend underground. Caves vary in size from small rooms barely large enough for you to stand to large complex tunnels that reach the bottom levels of the world.

                Giant chasms can form down here, as well as Lush Caves full of food and life; just keep an eye on your torch supply. Caves can be useful as large underground shelters and for your next step in survival; gathering raw materials.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Gather Raw Materials</h1>
            <img src="Images/MT10.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>By now you’ve probably had to replace your stone tools a few times and would like to upgrade to something better. Your next technological tier is iron, which is primarily found underground. If you found a decent cave complex this makes this part very easy. If not, you’re going to have to dig your way down and build a mine.</p>
