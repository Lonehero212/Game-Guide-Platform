                <h1>League of Legends</h1>
                <p>League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.</p>

            <div class="Tip1">
            <h1>TIP #1 Try Out Different Characters</h1>
            <p>If you’re just getting into League of Legends, don’t worry too much about trying to find the perfect character or position you’re best suited for. Instead, just focus on testing out a whole bunch of different characters. Actually, the more champions you try, the better sense you’ll get of what role suits your playstyle; be it ranged attack damage, melee fighting, or tanky support. Most game options don’t even become available until you get your profile to level 5, so having a young profile makes it a good time to play as many champions as you can.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Learn the Map</h1>
            <p>The main game map for League of Legends is called Summoner’s Rift and it’s made up of three lanes — top, middle, and bottom. The winding paths located in-between the lanes is referred to as the jungle and it’s where certain monsters spawn that can give your champion special buffs if you defeat them. Where you go as a starting position on the map should largely depend on the champion you chose since many are best suited for a particular role. The five main positions in League of Legends are top, mid, jungle, ADC, and support. As the name suggests, top is where the top lane champion starts. Tanks and bruisers fare well in top lane because they can survive on their own and generally either absorb or dish out a lot of damage. Mid lane champions typically focus on ability power (AP) and engage in one-on-one battles with the opposing team’s mid lane champion. The ADC (Attack Damage Carry) plays the bottom lane and needs to concentrate on farming minions early game in order to buy gear and increase their attack damage. The support also plays the bottom lane and has a variety of responsibilities including protecting the ADC, helping the ADC get kills, and placing vision wards to aid in map control. Jungle is the one position that doesn’t have an assigned lane; they’re supposed to level up by killing the monsters in the jungle and then make assassination attempts on enemy champions in lane.</p>

        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Try to Learn One Position Really Well</h1>
            <p>In order to really learn all the ins and outs of a particular position, you need to play it over and over again. Repeatedly playing the same position will also help you master the champions for that position and help make you a more competitive player.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4  Learn the Hotkeys</h1>
            <p>Much like in real-time strategy games, using hotkeys will save precious time in League of Legends, and could make the difference between winning or losing a battle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Stay Behind Minions</h1>
            <p>You should think of your minion waves as moving shields that save you from taking damage from enemy turrets and minions. Whenever there are friendly minions nearby, you should let them go into battle ahead of you so they can soak up damage while you concentrate on using your abilities and hitting specific targets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Stay Out of Enemy Turret Range</h1>
            <p>Staying behind your minions is a good rule to follow in general, but at no time is it more import than when you’re attacking an enemy turret. Turrets are defensive structures that deal increasing damage the longer you stand within their firing range. You should almost never try attacking a turret unless you have a substantial group of minions with you to act as a buffer. Knowing how difficult it can be to attack the enemy’s turret should also make it apparent that it’s a good idea to stay close to your own turret if you’re worried about stronger enemy champions killing you in lane.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Try to Survive as Long as Possible</h1>
            <p>Whenever you get killed by an enemy champion, that champion gets a large chunk of experience and gold. Repeatedly dying gives the enemy a huge advantage because it affords them the chance to to level up and purchase powerful gear more quickly. Not to mention dying takes your champion out of the game for a period of time that increases as the game goes on. If you can find a way to survive an engagement you think you might lose, it’s a much better outcome than just going all out and dying in a blaze of glory. Keep in mind the champion abilities you have at your disposal; some abilities might help you elude enemies in sticky situations. If you find you’re constantly getting caught and ganked by the enemy, try choosing the Summoner Spell “Flash” at the champion select screen. Using Flash allows your champion to teleport a short distance in any direction. It’s absolutely indispensable for getting out of tough spots and is pretty much a prerequisite for competitive play.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8  Learn How to Last-Hit</h1>
            <p>Many players who are new to League of Legends might think it’s fine to just sit back and auto-attack minion wave after minion wave until you’re in a position to attack the closest enemy turret, but this approach will surely cost you in the long run as you level up your profile and get matched against more skilled players. To really get the most out of minion waves, you should be focused on getting the killing blow on each possible minion because that way you get a gold bonus for the kill. This gold adds up quickly (especially if you’re the ADC) and can translate into your team getting the upper hand both in lane and in team fights. Keep an eye on enemy minion’s health bars and make sure you’re ready to attack when you see one low enough for you to kill with a single shot. The only position that shouldn’t be as concerned with last-hitting is the support because their job is to help the ADC get the last-hits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Learn the Language</h1>
            <p>Once you’ve been playing for a while, you might notice some players using specific acronyms or shorthand to describe different things in the game. Communicating this way saves keystroke, which saves time, which could give your team the competitive advantage in a tough match.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Communicate With Your Team</h1>
            <p>If your team can communicate with each other effectively, you’ll have a much better shot at winning than simply playing in silence. This doesn’t mean you all need put on headsets and get on a group chat, but you should always do things like call out what position you want to play before the game starts, or announce when the enemy champion(s) you’ve been fighting are missing from their lane. Of course, not everyone will always be as chatty as you want them to be, but that doesn’t mean they’re not benefiting from the information you give them.</p>
