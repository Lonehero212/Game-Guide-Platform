            <div class="Tip1">
            <h1>TIP #1 Explore Everywhere   </h1>
            <p>One of the most important tips for any open-world game is to pay attention to your surrounding and interact with everything you can. This is the same for Honkai: Star Rail since you can find plenty of chests, destructible objects, and readable in each area that you go to during the main or side quests.

                The open world of this game works a little differently since the areas are divided into multiple segments, and it's not exactly an open world completely. You'll also be able to see the total number of chests in each area including the ones you've opened on your map. This can be significantly helpful in exploration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Upgrade Selective Characters</h1>
            <img src="HST2.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Whenever you acquire a new character in the game, you'll be able to upgrade them and their Light Cone in the character section. This section can be accessed from the options on the top right of your screen. It takes special Character EXP materials to upgrade a character, and some more materials to ascend them.

                These materials are quite scarce, especially if you're a free-to-play gamer. If you're not buying the battle pass or special boxes for these items, it's important to ration them. A good rule is to upgrade a maximum of four characters at the start so that you can make a party with them, and save the leftover materials.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Use Your Stellar Jades Carefully</h1>
            <img src="HST3.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>The wide variety of characters in Honkai: Star Rail is one of its main attractions because of their design and abilities. To get most of these characters, you'll have to use the Stellar Jades in the Gacha System. If you play Genshin Impact, the Jades in this game are essentially the same as Primogems.

                If you're an F2P or low-spending player, one of the worst things you can do is refill your Trailblaze Power using the Stellar Jades. This dialog box pops up when you don't have enough power for a run, and it'll ask for about 60 Jades for the first refill. The price keeps increasing the more you do it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Time Management Is Important</h1>
            <img src="HST4.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Honkai: Star Rail is a type of game that requires you to log in every day and perform various daily tasks. However, you might not always have the time to finish every time-limited aspect of the game. In these scenarios, it's important to know how to prioritize the content</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Don't Skip The Dialogue</h1>
            <img src="HST5.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>The wide range of quests are at the core of Honkai: Star Rail and you'll easily get bored of the game if you try to rush the story or skip the dialogue. Much like other games from Hoyoverse, there will be a point when Star Rail won't have a lot of content apart from daily tasks. You'll reach this point quicker if you try to rush.

                Moreover, some quests will give you hints of the location of the desired items, and they won't be marked for you on the map. You'll also feel much closer to the game's lore and the characters you use if you know the part that they play in the story.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Don't Let Your Trailblaze Power Cap</h1>
            <img src="HST6.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>Once you've progressed into the game for a little bit, you'll see a special currency on the top right side of your screen when you open the map. This currency is called Trailblaze Power, and it can be used to farm a variety of things. When it's not capped, you'll regenerate one power every few minutes.

                The most important thing in Honkai: Star Rail is to not let this currency cap if you want to make the most out of it. At the start, you'll only have some Golden Calyx that you can spend them on, but this is also the time when you can horde character and Light Cone EXP materials. Use every bit of your power on them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Do Your Daily Training</h1>
            <img src="HST7.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>As you progress in the main story, you'll eventually land on Jarilo-VI planet. Go through the main story on this planet to reach the underground part of Belobog. Down here, you'll get to meet Seele as she makes a beautiful appearance, and your Daily Training will unlock after the first dialogue with her.

                This area can be accessed through the options on the top right side of your screen, and a bar will show the current amount of points you have here. This bar resets every day, and you can get up to 60 Stellar Jades from this. Below the bar, you'll see a few tasks and the points they'll provide after you finish them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Space Anchors Can Heal You</h1>
            <img src="HST8.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>In the main story, you can only use the Astral Express to go from one planet to another. Though this is quite tedious if you want to go to different planets repeatedly. This problem is solved by the Space Anchors in the game. You can see these Anchors marked with blue color on your map, and you can teleport to them at any point.

                Apart from instant teleportation, these Anchors also serve the purpose of regenerating your team's health. If you try to fight a strong opponent, some of your characters might end up being defeated. These characters will be revived automatically after the battle, but they'll also be on very low HP.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Read The Characters' Abilities</h1>
            <img src="HST9.avif" alt="Photo">
            <p>On the screen where you can see all your characters, you'll also see some options on the left. One of these options will be called "Traces", and you can see and upgrade all your character abilities in this section. Every character in the game has six types of abilities</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Gacha system</h1>
            <p>Gacha systems offer you valuable items that are randomly selected from a predetermined pool. Gacha systems can be used for characters, weapons, equipment, and other items that can drastically affect your gameplay. You “roll” or “pull” for items from banners, which means spending in-game currency to acquire a random gacha item. A banner is generally an event where items and characters are added to the game.</p>
