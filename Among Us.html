                <h1>Among Us</h1>
                <p>Among Us takes place in space-themed settings where players are colorful, armless cartoon astronauts. Each player takes on one of two roles: most are Crewmates, but a small number are Impostors. Crewmates work to complete assigned tasks in the game while identifying and voting out suspected Impostors (who appear identical to Crewmates) using social deduction, while Impostors have the objective of killing the Crewmates. </p>

            <div class="Tip1">
            <h1>TIP #1 Finish Task</h1>
            <img src="AT1.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>It is important to Finish the task as quickly as possible as a Crewmates as it wins the game for you if all the crewmates can finish the task before they are all wipe out by the Impostor who will be killing them is if you can figure out who it is this is the best option for winning</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Report dead bodies immediately</h1>
            <img src="AT3.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p> If you happen to come across a dead body, be sure to tap the report button right away. If another player sees you running away from a dead body, they will likely suspect you are the imposter and you will get voted out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Stay in Groups</h1>
            <img src="AT3.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>The easiest way to stay safe as a crewmate is to work in groups. This will make it harder for an imposter to kill you. It will also allow other players to vouch for your whereabouts if a body is discovered. The more imposters there are in a game, the larger the group you will need to be safe.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Use emergency meetings to plan a strategy</h1>
            <img src="AT4.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>. You don't just have to use emergency meetings to make accusations and discuss who the imposter is. You can also use them to make suggestions and plan a strategy. Let other players know you are going to complete a visual task or something else that clears your name. Also, make sure you talk during meetings or have a good reason for calling a meeting, otherwise other players may become suspicious.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Be careful who you do tasks in front of</h1>
            <img src="AT5.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p> Tasks often take up the entire screen while you are completing them. This leaves you blind. Be sure not to do tasks in front of somebody who is acting suspiciously.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Do visual tasks in front of other players</h1>
            <img src="At6.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p>Visual tasks confirm for other players that you are not the imposter. Doing visual tasks without other players around to see it is kind of a waste. Make sure to do visual tasks only when other players are around.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Try to fix sabotages when possible </h1>
            <img src="AT^jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p> Most sabotages prevent players from calling an emergency meeting. Some sabotages (such as reactor meltdown and oxygen depletion) are critical sabotages that will cause crewmates to lose the game if they are not fixed in time. Be sure to fix sabotages when you can, but be aware that some sabotages can be used to set traps. Work in groups when possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Watch out for suspicious behavior</h1>
            <img src="/AT8.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p> While this may not be 100% incriminating, the following are examples of suspicious behavior that you should look out for</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Skip voting if you don't know who the imposter is</h1>
            <img src="/AT9.jpg" alt="Photo">
            <p> If you don't have a good idea who the imposter is, select the option to skip voting. Voting the wrong person out will give you one less player and bring the imposter closer to winning.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Continue completing tasks as a ghost</h1>
            <p> If you do get killed by the imposter, you're not completely out of the game. You won't be able to chat, vote, or call meetings, but you can still complete tasks. This will help the rest of your crewmates win the game.</p>
