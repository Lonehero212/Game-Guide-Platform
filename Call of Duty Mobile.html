            <div class="Tip1">
            <h1>TIP #1 Learn the Maps</h1>
            <p>This tip shouldn’t need to have to be said. It should be completely self-understood, but of course, half of you are stupid and the majority of the rest of you are even dumber. So here we go. I’m wasting my first tip on this.

                Spend time, going around the map and exploring. Yes, it’s a waste of time, and yes, you will want to just fight instead. But, if you know the map well, you will SO MUCH better at the game. It’s that simple.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Watch the Pros</h1>
            <p>Many of you are already doing this tip, but for those of you that aren’t, this is a great tip! Find the good players who stream or record themselves and watch them play.

                You will learn so much just by seeing the techniques that they use.
                
                You may have to be careful with this technique. Some of the famous players are more famous for their personalities than for their skills. They couldn’t shoot an enemy combatant even if he was blocking the scope.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Strafing</h1>
            <p>Strafing is moving from side to side in order to make it harder for your enemy to shoot you, but all the while keeping your aim focused on your enemy.

                This obviously requires you to keep a balanced equilibrium between the two joysticks. If you move to the left, you will need to focus your head/gun on the right. And vise versa.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Ranking Up Quickly</h1>
            <p>The fastest way to rank up quickly is by playing a lot of Domination and a lot of Serarch and Destroy. Those game modes offer a lot more XP and therefore faster climb upwards.

                Don’t UNDERESTIMATE the XP. Play the two aforementioned modes and get yourself ranked up like a pro!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Use Headphones/Earphones</h1>
            <p>This technique is not just so that you don’t annoy your sister. Use earphones so that you can hear the game quicker and more accurately.

                Even with the best phone, the nuances of the sound will be distorted by the time it reaches your ears. Additionally, the precious 1/1200 second for the sound to travel 1 foot will give less time to react.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Use the Correct Weapon</h1>
            <p>Weapons in COD Mobile Tips for Call of Duty: Mobile
                You wouldn’t show up to a 80th birthday party with a bag of baby pacifiers, don’t show up at a map without the incorrect weapons.
                
                A big map (like Crossfire) most successful with a sniper gun or a gun with less recoil. A smaller map (like Killhouse or Nuketown) will be more successful with an assault rifle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7 Use the Correct Perks</h1>
            <p>This is important and is the type of stupidity that you see all the beginner-players doing. Make sure that you use the CORRECT PERKS with the appropriate game-mode.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Pop Socket</h1>
            <p>This is an incredible technique that no one talks about. Buy a freakin pop-socket for your phone. Pop sockets are those things that you connect to the back of your phone so that you can hold it with more support. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Start off Strong </h1>
            <p>This is a great way to get quick and easy kills right at the beginning. This won’t work on all maps, but most of the time this will be incredibly effective.

                Start off running towards the most natural destination of where the enemy would be coming from, and then BE READY. Use a gun that has lots of ammo and have your scope to shoot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Get a Good Connection</h1>
            <p>Internet Connection for Gaming 
                Unless you enjoy rubberbanding and freezing, make sure that you get a good connection. Yes, that may mean that you will no longer be able to steal wifi from neighbors living three blocks away.</p>
