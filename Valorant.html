                <h1>VALORANT</h1>
            <p>VALORANT has grown exponentially in popularity since its release in 2020. It has persuaded players from all across the globe to give this tactical hero shooter a try. VALORANT can be challenging to get good at initially. The combination of hero-like abilities in a tactical and strategic shooter setting needs a bit of getting used to, which is why we’ve gathered the 13 best VALORANT tips for beginners in this article.

                Getting good at this game takes time and practice. We all know how hard ranked is, especially with instant lockers, bad teammates, and poor communication. Some tips, however, can make your journey a whole lot easier. In this article, we will be going over 13 tips that can help you in learning the game.</p>

            <h1>TIP #1 Use Optimal VALORANT Settings</h1>
            <p>Before we get into more mechanical and strategical tips, the first thing you need to do is to optimize your settings. Having the optimal settings can give you a little boost in ranked. This means having a comfortable sensitivity, good crosshair, and optimal video settings for high fps. We already have a whole article covering all of the best VALORANT options and settings, so we recommend checking that one out. They are taken from the best players in VALORANT (the pros) and are an ideal place to start.</p>

        <div class="Tip2">
            <h1>TIP #2 Find Comfortable Agents to Main</h1>
            <p>To win matches consistently, you need to build a pool of agents that you are comfortable with. While having a single main like Jett sounds good, if she is taken you don’t have another agent to fill. A good idea is to learn and master at least 4-5 agents, in all roles. Having a wider selection of comfortable agents makes filling for your team easier.

                Example: your teams need a controller, and you are pretty good with Omen, meaning that you can fill with him. On the other hand, if you had only one main, you’d be playing with an uncomfortable agent the whole game.
                
                Of course, learning and mastering an agent takes time and practice, but if you truly want to get good at VALORANT you will need to dedicate a significant amount of time to the game. Of course players will always have one or two agents they feel best on and we’re not saying that you should completely master a big variety of agents, but it definitely pays off to be at least proficient at all roles.
                
                For beginners, these are the agents that are easier to master: Brimstone and Omen for controllers, Killjoy and Sage for sentinels, Reyna, Raze or Phoenix for Duelists, and Sova, Breach or Fade for initiators.

        <div class="Tip3">
            <h1>TIP #3 Communicate With Your Team</h1>
            <p>As a team-based game, communication is one the most important parts of winning your games and ranking up in VALORANT. Playing together as a unit can and will improve your odds of winning any game, so speaking up is of crucial importance.

                Even basic callouts for utilities and enemy positions can help your team out in winning the round. Sometimes your teammates can be hesitant in communication, so you should try to be the first one to initiate communication. Better teamwork can be the catalyst for your ranked growth.
                
                Comms are especially hard in lower ranks because many players are starting out and don’t have mics or don’t want to use them. In this case, you need to be the conscientious person who carries out your duty, which will encourage the players to open up and give comms and win more games. And even if they don’t speak up themselves: your call that alerts a teammate of a flank can make or break rounds, so keep talking, even if no one talks back and it feels a little awkward.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip4">
            <h1>TIP #4 Understand All Maps and Agents</h1>
            <p>Starting the game and having to learn the maps and agents might seem a little fatiguing but if you’re up to it, the process is very fun and fulfilling to do. Playing unrated gives you insight into how the various maps and agents are played and how the comms and callouts work. 

                There is always more to learn about the maps and the agents you play. There are lineups, off-angles, and much more. If you are losing matches on a certain map, you need to learn about the map more. Look into how rotations work, what the best positions are, and find angles to hold based on your playstyle. It won’t hurt to jump into a custom game and figure out the map for yourself.
                
                Having a better understanding of agents, maps and the mechanics of the game will help you win more games and rank up, so we recommend reading up on all of the abilities and ultimates that the agents have before jumping into ranked games. You don’t want to come up against a Killjoy (for example) while having no idea what her ult does. If you’ve been out of the game for a while and a new agent has come out, experiment with the agent in an offline server and get to know the agent a bit before jumping into a ranked match.</p>

        <div class="Tip5">
            <h1>TIP #5 Try To Avoid Tilt</h1>
            <p>You lost a couple of games, or maybe you are not just feeling your aim right now. Whatever the reason is, it’s always a good idea to keep a positive mindset toward the game. Tilting is like a snowball effect: you tilt, you play worse, and you tilt again. It worsens your decision-making and makes you make bad plays. Tilting the other team is a strategy pros use to gain an advantage, so playing while tilted is never a good idea.

                It might sound a bit crazy but if you are having a bad day, just take a break. If you can’t switch to a more passive playstyle and/or nothing is working, there’s no use in grinding out the ranked ladder. Getting angry over little things only makes the game more painful. At the end of the day, it’s a game, and if you are not having fun, just log off for a few hours.</p>

        <div class="Tip6">
            <h1>TIP #6 Focus on Improving Movement and Aim</h1>
            <p>Aiming is where almost all players struggle. Hitting headshots consistently is a skill that’s can be hard to master. However, there are some tips and tricks that make aiming a lot easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip7">
            <h1>TIP #7  Gamesense and VOD Reviews</h1>
            <p>Gamesense is something that you’ll improve as you play ranked matches. Playing more games will force you into situations that require good decision-making. At the start of your VALORANT career you might make poor plays, but as you understand the game more you will find yourself making these mistakes less and making better decisions. Gamesense is something that comes naturally by playing games, but there are some ways to improve faster.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip8">
            <h1>TIP #8 Warm Up Before Your Sessions</h1>
            <p>Have you ever seen an athlete go into a match without warming up? VALORANT is the same as any other sport. Yes, it’s not as physically demanding but you still need to warm up your mechanics before any session.  

                You don’t need a complex and long routine to warm up 5-10 minutes in the range or a deathmatch session or two is usually enough to get the blood pumping in your hands.
                
                When you don’t warm up before a ranked session you end up whiffing shots, which can decrease your confidence. This can in turn lead to you losing more duels in-game, and all of this can quickly spiral out of control. Skip this annoying process by warming up properly so that you can start your ranked matches in full confidence and ready to frag out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip9">
            <h1>TIP #9 Learn to Manage Economy</h1>
            <p>Learning how to use the economy of VALORANT correctly can help you win games in ways that lower-ranked players don’t think about much.

                Just deciding when to save and when to buy is enough to manage the economy in VALORANT. When you start a round you can see how much money you will get the next round on the buy menu. Use that to decide whether to buy or save.
                
                Important here is that your whole team follows the same strategy. If you have enough money for a rifle buy and the rest of your team doesn’t then you should also eco (meaning you save your money for the next round) or do a half buy at most. If you buy and your teammates save in this situation, you won’t have enough money the next round and your team will be playing with 4 full buys and 1 eco, drastically lowering the chances of winning the round.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Tip10">
            <h1>TIP #10 Stop Blaming Your Team</h1>
            <p>The main reason people claim they’re stuck in their ranks is their teammates, which can be true in some cases. However, the primary reason for not climbing is your own skill level. That’s why you’re here – to improve and reach Radiant. Many players make numerous mistakes in their games and then blame their teammates. The first step to improvement is acknowledging your errors and working on your gameplay.</p>
